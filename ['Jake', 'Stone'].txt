This semester in PreCalculus With Proofs we covered many subjects, including proving theorems using critical thinking, using the mathematical laws of induction to solve problems, solving triangles using sin, cos, and tan, and applying already proved theorems to new problems. We had daily homework consisting of note-taking and worksheets, as well as assessments such as our unit 1 test.
Jake, you did a great job in the class this semester! You showcased proficiency in many learning targets, including using the mathematical laws of induction to solve problems, and effectively showcased your grasp of the material. You demonstrated this understanding exceptionally on the assessments this unit, earning a(n) A on our most recent unit 3 test. Something you could improve moving forward would be applying already proved theorems to new problems, but you are doing proficiently overall. 
This class can be challenging to some, but you have handled it very well, Jake. You should be proud of your A in this class this semester, and I look forward to seeing you continue to thrive in this class during the rest of the year.
