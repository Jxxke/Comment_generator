This semester in Accelerated Chemistry we covered many subjects, including investigating nuclear decay, using stoichiometry to determine the amount of molecules in a substance, analysing intermolecular forces in molecules, and identifying the different types of reactions between compounds. We had daily homework consisting of pogil work and worksheets, as well as assessments such as our unit 1 test.
Patty, you did a good job in the class this semester. You showcased proficiency in some of our learning targets, including using stoichiometry to determine the amount of molecules in a substance, and usually showcased your grasp of the material. You demonstrated this understanding well on the assessments this unit, earning a(n) B- on our most recent spinach lab. Something you could improve moving forward would be identifying the different types of reactions between compounds, but you are doing well overall. There there is always room for improvement, but you should be proud of your work this semester! 
This class can be challenging, but you were able to maintain a handle on it, Patty. You earned a B in this class this semester, and I am confident that I will see your skills continue to develop throughout the rest of the year.
