This semester in Differential equation we covered many subjects, including Defining and using Laplace transforms, solve systems of first order linear equations using differential operator, Laplace transform, and matrix methods including finding eigenvalues and eigenvectors and interpreting solutions of linear systems, Using Bernoulli methods, and Determing whether unique solutions exist. We had daily homework consisting of Notes and Exams, as well as assessments such as our Exam 1.
Anay, you did a great job in the class this semester! You showcased proficiency in many learning targets, including solve systems of first order linear equations using differential operator, Laplace transform, and matrix methods including finding eigenvalues and eigenvectors and interpreting solutions of linear systems, and effectively showcased your grasp of the material. You demonstrated this understanding exceptionally on the assessments this unit, earning a(n) A on our most recent Exam 3. Something you could improve moving forward would be Determing whether unique solutions exist, but you are doing proficiently overall. 
This class can be challenging to some, but you have handled it very well, Anay. You should be proud of your A in this class this semester, and I look forward to seeing you continue to thrive in this class during the rest of the year.
