This semester in AP Calculus BC we covered many subjects, including Evaluating derivatives and integrals, Evaluating derivatives and integrals, Finding derivative of a parametric function, and Finding derivative of a parametric function. We had daily homework consisting of note-taking and worksheets, as well as assessments such as our Exam 1.
Sean, you did a great job in the class this semester! You showcased proficiency in many learning targets, including Evaluating derivatives and integrals, and effectively showcased your grasp of the material. You demonstrated this understanding exceptionally on the assessments this unit, earning a(n) A- on our most recent Exam5. Something you could improve moving forward would be Finding derivative of a parametric function, but you are doing proficiently overall. 
This class can be challenging to some, but you have handled it very well, Sean. You should be proud of your A in this class this semester, and I look forward to seeing you continue to thrive in this class during the rest of the year.
