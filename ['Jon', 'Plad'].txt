This semester in US History 10 we covered many subjects, including The Civil War, Modern-Day USA, The Gilded Age, and The American Revolution. We had daily homework consisting of reading and taking notes and preparing projects, as well as assessments such as our Written Exam 1.
Jon, this semester proved a bit challenging for you. You showcased proficiency in few of our learning targets, and many subjects need a bit of improvement, such as The Gilded Age. You were occassionally showcased your grasp of the material but you struggled on some of our assessments, getting a(n) B- on our most recent Exam 3. Some key subjects to work on include The Women's Suffrage Movement and The Gilded Age. Moving forward, I would reccommend that you meet with me often to make sure your understanding is strong, and perhaps working with peers on some of our homework assignments. You have room for improvement, but with hard work I believe you can turn this class around next semester! 
This class can be challenging, so it is alright to struggle early on, Jon. You earned a C in this class this semester, but I am confident that I will see your skills develop and improve throughout the rest of the year.
